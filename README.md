# RE:ddit - a Reddit Client
### [RE:ddit](https://re-ddit.netlify.app)
Built as part of coursework for the Codecademy Front End Engineer syllabus, RE:ddit is a lightweight Reddit client built to offer an alternative UI. RE:ddit utilizes React as its core framework along with SPA structure built upon React Router, and expands upon this base with Redux to manage state.

## Features

### Tile-Based UI

The core principle behind RE:ddit's structure is reinterpreting the standard Reddit layout of vertically-stacked links. Users engage with a significant amount of media across many contexts on Reddit, so RE:ddit seeks to place that engagement in the forefront of the browsing experience. By enabling a rapid preview of content, users can at a glance take in the breadth of content on a given subreddit and single out any posts of interest to investigate further.

### Responsive Design

RE:ddit utilizes media queries and a responsive approach to its structure, ensuring that user experience is consistently tailored to any device format.
